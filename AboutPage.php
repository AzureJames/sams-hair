    <h1>ABOUT SAM KWETIO</h1>

    <p>I've been hairstyling for 15 years and have been serving St Albert since 2019.</p>
    <p>This super fun career has brought me to Montreal, Toronto, California, even Spain, for classes and team events with brands I love working with.</p>
    <p>Kwetio (Gweh-DEE-oh) is an Iroquois name I've grown up with and have finally embraced.</p>
    <p>I have two young daughters with my husband, and we're currently commuting in from Morinville.</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>I'm your service provider first, and your buddy second!</p>
        <p>This means when you're in my chair. I might say "No" but it's for your benefit, I promise. Getting the hair you want can sometimes mean getting set up for a journey, and I swear you'll look amazing every step of the way. I thrive off of connecting with my guests, so once I get acquainted with your aesthetic, you'll get hairstyles that are authentic to you, AND we'll have a blast! </p>
