        <h2>Policies</h2>
        <p>We love all of our clients at Voodoo Hair Studio, and I want to make sure everyone feels at home in our friendly hair salon. That’s why I’ve set a couple basic policies to make sure everyone who walks through our doors has an experience that leaves them wanting to return time and again. Take a quick read. If you have any questions, just get in touch.</p>

        <h2>Cancellations & Rescheduling</h2>
        <p>Just Let Me Know</p>
        <p>I know life happens and sometimes things come up, but here are some things to keep in mind when changing your appointments:</p>
        <p>- Cancellations/Rescheduling with at least 48 hours notice will be moved without issue</p>
        <p>- Cancellations/Rescheduling within the 48 hour window will require a $50 deposit to book a new appointment.</p>
        <p>- If you don't show up for your appointment and don't call/email/text at all, the full amount of the missed appointment will be required to book again. A deposit may be required to book future appointments.</p>
